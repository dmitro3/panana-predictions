Our goal is to continue developing Panana Predictions beyond the hackathon, expanding its features and user base.

- **Commits**: Over 100 commits
- **Lines of Code**: Over 10,000 lines of code

## Tech Stack

Panana Predictions leverages a modern and robust tech stack to provide a seamless user experience:

- **Aptos Move**: Provides the decentralized platform for our smart contracts.
- **Next.js**: A state-of-the-art React framework for building the web application.
- **React**: For building interactive user interfaces.
- **TypeScript**: Ensuring type safety and code reliability.
- **Bun**: Powers the backend server.
- **Switchboard Oracles**: Used for fetching reliable asset price data.
- **Telegram Bot API**: Integrates the platform into Telegram for easy user access.

Our marketplace and market move modules are designed for decentralized security, ensuring that all transactions are transparent and secure.

## Architecture Overview

Panana Predictions consists of three fundamental parts:

### 1. Marketplace and Market Move Modules

At the heart of Panana Predictions are the **Marketplace** and **Market Move Modules**.

**Technical Details:**
- The **Marketplace Module** manages all markets for a specific asset (i.e. APT or BTC)
- The **Market Module** handles the interactions for placing bets, transferring assets, and distributing winnings based on market outcomes.
- Contracts are written in **Move**, a blockchain-specific programming language optimized for the Aptos ecosystem.
- All modules are designed in a way that allows an **easy extension** to add new Markets and asset types.
- **Switchboard Oracles** ensure a trusted and decentralized resolution of markets.

### 2. Telegram App & Web Application (Next.js)

To interact with the prediction markets, users access the platform via Telegram or the web. Built as a cutting-edge **Next.js** web application optimzed for mobile and desktop, the front-end provides a seamless and intuitive interface for users to:

- **Create new markets:** Every user can create new markets. 
- **Browse available markets:** See what prediction opportunities are currently open.
- **Place predictions:** Easily select and place a prediction on asset price movements.
- **Track market outcomes:** View the status of open and resolved markets.
- **Track personal success:** View personal statistics, such as how many markets a user has participated in.
- **Live Data:** All markets are showing live data from the Aptos blockchain.


### 3. Server for Auto-Resolving Markets

The third component is a **server** that is responsible for automatically resolving prediction markets when they close. The server polls for new markets and is responsible for their resolution. Once a market is created, the server:

- **Schedules the resolution**: The server schedules a new job to resolve the market at a specific time.

Once a market reaches its resolution time, the server:

- **Triggers market resolution:** The server calls the Market module to retrieve the final price data on-chain via a Switchboard Oracle and distribute the rewards.
- **Ensures eventual resolution:** By implementing a retry-mechanism in case the initial resolution failed, an eventual resolution is guaranteed.
